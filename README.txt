A Novel Framework for Hydrological Model Calibration and Evaluation based on Extracted Dynamic Catchment Characteristics
Introduction
This research aims to develop a reliable sub-period calibration scheme and its evaluation system, addressing the issues present in the existing calibration methods for dynamic seasonal changes within catchments. The framework has been tested on the MOPEX dataset, incorporating both the code and data utilized in the study.

Environment Requirements
The code has been tested on Matlab R2023b. It is recommended to use the same or a compatible version to ensure full compatibility.

File Structure
00 Data: Contains all the raw data and calculated results.
03 Sub Period Calibration: Implements calibration for different sub-periods.
04 Comprehensive Evaluation: Contains code for comprehensive evaluation of the indices.
05 State Variables and Fluxes: Provides plotting for state variables and fluxes.

Installation Guide
Ensure that Matlab R2023b is installed on your machine. No additional toolboxes are required for the base functionality of the framework. However, specific scripts may require additional Matlab or python toolboxes.

Usage
To get started, navigate to the root directory of the project in Matlab and run the main script associated with each step of the framework.
